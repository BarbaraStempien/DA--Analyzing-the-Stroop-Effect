## Description

In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participantâ€™s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. 

The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the **congruent words condition**, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: 

![Congruent Words](word-set1.png "Congruent Words")

In the **incongruent words condition**, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed:

![Congruent Words](word-set2.png "Congruent Words")

In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.

You can try out the Stroop task for yourself by going to the [Interactive Stroop Effect Experiment](https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/java/ready.html), which is a Java-based applet for performing the Stroop task.
